My name is Shaun Smith and I'm a software developer, amateur woodworker and tinkerer.  You've found [disgone.com]({{< ref "/" >}}), my personal slice of the web.  I use this space as a proverbial [junk drawer](https://www.npr.org/sections/theprotojournalist/2014/08/15/337759135/what-your-junk-drawer-reveals-about-you) on things I find interesting.  I'm currently based in the Dallas, Texas area.
